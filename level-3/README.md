# Escape room style mini game

This project is the final project for my first year of studies as a frontend developer. We were tasked with making an escape roomn styled game with 3 challenges to it. I created a level with 3 rooms and multiple items that interact with eachother. Some items on the scene are dependant of other items being collected already, and the final piece to escape the level requires multiple items to have been collected, changed, or found.
